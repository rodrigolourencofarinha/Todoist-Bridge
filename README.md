# Todoist Bridge

This is an **unofficial fork** of [HeroBlackInk/ultimate-todoist-sync-for-obsidian](https://github.com/HeroBlackInk/ultimate-todoist-sync-for-obsidian).

I created it because the original plugin has been inactive and some issues were blocking my workflow.  
Instead of rebuilding the project from source, I patched the distributed files (`main.js` and `manifest.json`).  
It works, but it‚Äôs a quick fix ‚Äî not a clean rebuild.

## Installation
1. Download this repo.  
2. Copy it into your Obsidian plugins folder:

```
.obsidian/plugins/todoist-bridge/
```
3. Reload Obsidian and enable **Todoist Bridge**.


## Status
- ‚úîÔ∏è Functional  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May require manual workarounds  
- üöß Possible future: cleaned up and published as a proper Obsidian plugin
